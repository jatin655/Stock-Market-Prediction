# Stock Market Prediction App using Brain.js

A comprehensive stock market prediction application built with React, Next.js, and Brain.js neural networks. This app demonstrates AI-powered financial forecasting with an intuitive user interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Neural Network Prediction**: Uses Brain.js to train feedforward neural networks for stock price prediction
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Real-time charts showing historical data and AI predictions using Chart.js
- **Flexible Data Input**: Support for JSON and CSV file uploads, plus sample dataset
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Real-time Training**: Watch the model train and see performance metrics
- **Extended Forecasting**: Predict multiple days into the future with confidence indicators

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Next.js 14, TypeScript
- **AI/ML**: Brain.js (Neural Networks)
- **Visualization**: Chart.js
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## üìä How It Works

### Neural Network Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 5 neurons (looks at 5 previous stock prices)
- **Hidden Layers**: Two layers with 10 and 8 neurons respectively
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron (predicts next price)
- **Activation Function**: Sigmoid
- **Training Algorithm**: Backpropagation with configurable learning rate

### Data Processing
1. **Normalization**: Stock prices are normalized to 0-1 range for optimal training
2. **Sequence Creation**: Uses sliding window approach to create training sequences
3. **Prediction**: Trained model predicts future prices using recent price patterns
4. **Denormalization**: Predictions are converted back to actual price scale

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd stock-prediction-app
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. Run the development server:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üìÅ Data Format

### JSON Format
\`\`\`json
[
  {"date": "2024-01-01", "price": 150.25},
  {"date": "2024-01-02", "price": 152.10},
  {"date": "2024-01-03", "price": 148.75}
]
\`\`\`

### CSV Format
\`\`\`csv
date,price
2024-01-01,150.25
2024-01-02,152.10
2024-01-03,148.75
\`\`\`

## üß† Model Logic

The application uses a feedforward neural network with the following approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Normalizes price data to improve training stability
   - Creates sequences of 5 consecutive prices as input features

2. **Training Process**:
   - Uses supervised learning with historical price sequences
   - Trains for up to 2000 iterations or until error threshold is met
   - Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting

3. **Prediction Generation**:
   - Takes the last 5 prices as input
   - Generates predictions for specified number of future days
   - Uses sliding window approach for multi-day forecasting

4. **Confidence Calculation**:
   - Based on recent price volatility
   - Higher volatility = lower confidence
   - Provides realistic uncertainty estimates

## üìö Third-Party Libraries

- **brain.js**: Neural network library for JavaScript
- **chart.js**: Flexible charting library for data visualization
- **@radix-ui/react-***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **lucide-react**: Beautiful & consistent icon toolkit

## üöÄ Deployment

The app is optimized for deployment on Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with default settings
